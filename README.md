# Famous last words

We, as engineers, designers, etc. hear a lot of madness in technology startups. We voiceless pawns see the reaper coming before management does. We know when a project is doomed to fail but no one would listen.

This is a recollection of things people famously say mere moments before the end. It is our utmost duty to document these for the next generationsâ€¦

**Join the cause, document your own experience.**
